    Attributes:
        _serial_dev (str): Path to the serial device.
        _baud_rate (int): The baud rate for the serial device.
        _timeout (int): Timeout for the serial reads in seconds.
        _serial_cv (threading.Condition): Condition variable for synchronizing class.
        _serial (serial.Serial): The pyserial object for serial communications.
        _serial_task_thread (threading.Thread): Runs the internal restart task.
        _stopped (bool): Whether the class has been stopped.
        _started (bool): Whether the class has been started.
